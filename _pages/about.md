I am a PhD student in [Modeling and Engineering Risk and Complexity (MERC)](https://www.ssmeridionale.it/it-it/dottorato/rubriche/modeling-and-engineering-risk-and-complexity-merc-3123-1-017870059a030b9af70ed6080d930af0?programma-ospiti-14434#hprogramma-ospiti) at the Scuola Superiore Meridionale, Naples, Italy.
I am advised by [Francesco Bullo](https://me.ucsb.edu/people/francesco-bullo) and [Giovanni Russo](https://sites.google.com/view/giovanni-russo/home?authuser=0). My research primarily focuses on the modelling and analysis of biologically inspired Neural Networks.

In 2019, I graduated in Mathematics at the [University of Catania](https://web.dmi.unict.it), with a thesis entitled “Variational Equilibrium, Lagrangian Theory, and Applications to Network Models”.

In 2020, I held an annual scholarship at the [Italian National Institute for Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) in Catania](https://www.ct.ingv.it) on the topic “Mathematical models for volcanic hazard monitoring and decision-making methods for risk mitigation and uncertainty quantification”.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, soccer, exploring new places... and eating pizza!
